# EEG-Visual-Multiclass-Classification
This work addresses the challenge of EEG multiclass classification into 40 classes for BCI applications, by using deep learning architectures. Multi-class classification approach offers BCI applications a significant advantage since it allows the supervision of more than one BCI interaction, considering that each class label supervises a BCI task.
